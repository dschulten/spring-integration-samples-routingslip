= Routing Slip Example

== External routing slip

*Problem*

A spring-integration routing slip pojo or `RoutingSlipRouteStrategy` must return the name of the next channel to which a message should be routed, and it is asked for routes until its routes are exhausted, at which point it is supposed to return `null`.

However, it is a singleton and therefore cannot maintain status information upon which it could decide which route is next.

*Solution*

A possible solution is to maintain the status in message headers.

See `ExternalRoutingSlipRouteStrategy` and `ExternalRoutingSlipRoutePojo` and `RoutingSlipAppl√≠cation` for an example flow.
